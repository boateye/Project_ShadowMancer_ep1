description: "[b]**Patch 1.22 Is now up. Patch notes are in the discussion thread for Patch 1.22**[/b]\n\nProject: ShadowMancer is a fan adaptation of William Gibson\'s book, [i]Neuromancer[/i], into the Shadowrun Returns engine. This episode, \"The Screaming Fist\" covers the opening chapter of the [i]Neuromancer[/i] story.\n\nWhat started out as a simple exercise for me to get familiar with the SRR editor is taking a life of its own. This is my first ever UGC, so it is quite rough around the edges. There will be some erroneous typos, and weirdness, so please feel free to comment below or in the discussion threads with feedback! I pushed this version out because I am fairly happy with what I have at this point, and I want to gauge interest.\n\n**Current Dependencies**\n\nShadowrun Returns - Seattle assets\nShadowrun Returns - Berlin assets\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=165898135&searchtext=more+stairs]More Stairs and Doors by Ferragus [/url]\n\nSome of these maps are imported from the following UGCs (you [b]MIGHT[/b] need these to play ShadowMancer):\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=165397289]Sprawl Sites by King Schiebi[/url]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=171109985]Shadowrunner\342\200\231s Apartment One.Eight by CRB82[/url]\n\n[url=www.project-shadowmancer.tumblr.com]If you want more informaiton about the progress of Project: ShadowMancer, check out the development blog here.[/url]"
