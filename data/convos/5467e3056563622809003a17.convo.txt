  text: "{{GM}}Shuriken had always fascinated you. Steel stars with knife-sharp points. Some are chrome, others black, others treated with a rainbow surface similar to oil on water. \n\nThe crome stars hold your gaze. They are mounted against scarlet ultrasuede with almost invisible loops of nylon fishing line. Their centers are stamped with either dragons or yin-yang symbols. They caught the street\'s neon lights and twisted it. Then it hit you: these are the stars under which you voyaged. Your destiny spelled out in a constellation of cheap chrome.{{/GM}}"
